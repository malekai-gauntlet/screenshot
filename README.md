# Screenshot To Chat

Instantly send screenshots to your Cursor chat window. No more dragging screenshots from your desktop.

## Requirements

- MacOS (only available on Mac)
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher

## Setup

1. Open Cursor

2. Go to Extensions (Cmd+Shift+X)

3. Search for "Screenshot To Chat"

4. Click Install

5. Now, if you do Control+Command+Shift+4, that screenshot will automatically show up in your Cursor chat.

6. I'd recommend adjusting the keyboard shortcut to Command+Shift+3 since Control+Command+Shift+4 is pretty awkward on the fingers lol.

7. You can adjust ^this in Apple System Settings -> Keyboard Shortcuts --> Screenshots --> Change keyboard combo of copy picture of selected area to the clipboard.

FYI: If you already have a screenshot in the Chat, this shortcut won't work. (If you have a fix, lmk!)
