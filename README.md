### Better Keyboard Shortcut

Control+Command+Shift+4 is pretty awkward on the fingers lol. I'd recommend changing it to Command+Shift+3. Here's how:

1. Open Apple System Settings
2. Go to Keyboard Shortcuts -> Screenshots
3. Change "Copy picture of selected area to the clipboard" to whatever feels better



## Known Quirks

- FYI: If you already have a screenshot in the Chat, this shortcut won't work. (If you have a fix, lmk!)
- Currently Mac-only (sorry Windows!)

## Troubleshooting

If your screenshots aren't showing up:
1. Restart Cursor
2. Ensure extension is enabled
3. Double-check you're using the right keyboard shortcut
